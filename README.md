# Data-Manipulation


The data set has information on the flights over the year 2004 and if a particular flight was delayed or not. The idea is to answer the following questions
1.	Find out the number of delayed flights for all weekdays
2.	Find the average distance, total distance and count for all delayed flights on Friday.
3.	Find out how many flights were on time on Week days and Weekends (Consider Saturday and Sunday as weekends)
4.	Find out the number of flights for each destination across all weekdays
5.	Find out the number of times weather was bad across all weekdays. (1 indicates bad weather)
